# TO-DO
- [ ] Every question you complete gives you a QXP, with multipliers for streaks etc. 
- [ ] It needs a... Scraper.
- [ ] Might need to borrow pdf parser
- [ ] 'QXP earned: ' 
- [ ] Database
- [ ] :-( :-| :-) ùùà - whil eyou're playing. The sigma is multicoloured
- [ ] Main loop
- [ ] approximation game
- [ ] ranking mode
- [ ] need a json list of q's and a's under certain categories.
- [ ] Add a timer showing how long each one takes 
- [ ] Make it ‚Äògrindable
- [ ] Badges custom name thin about the mechanics 

- [ ] Simple, more simple. 
- [ ] full trading sim - make it addictibe, like gamvling. 
- [ ] ‚Ñû +/0
- [ ] puts you in the top % of people (quantile)
- [ ] what makes speed typing test good... it's simple. you get good scores. 
- [ ] Use it to practice like call‚Äôs puts

# Things I expect to see from the ZetaMatrix Data
- (when I realised I was truly grateful that I found data science as my craft - the dotplot)
- The 10's column should have very quick times
- learning curves

# Data Inference ideas 
`1, 2, 4, and 8 primarily` 

1. **Rate of Improvement**: By tracking a user's performance over time, you can visualize their learning curve. Some users might show rapid initial improvement followed by a plateau, while others might demonstrate steady incremental improvement. This could reflect different learning styles and strategies.

2. **Problem Areas**: If a user consistently struggles with a specific number combination or operation (e.g., multiplying by 8), you could infer that this is a challenging area for them. This could be used to offer targeted practice or exercises.

3. **Time of Day Analysis**: By timestamping each answer, you can analyze performance variations based on the time of day. For example, are users typically faster in the morning, afternoon, or evening? This could provide insights into optimal brain performance times.

4. **Effects of Practice**: If a user consistently plays the game daily vs. someone who plays sporadically, do they show different improvement rates? This could underscore the importance of regular practice in skill acquisition.

5. **Stamina and Focus**: How does performance degrade over a single session? If a user plays for an extended period, do they get slower, indicating mental fatigue?

6. **Comparative Analysis**: Based on demographics or self-reported data (like age, educational background, etc.), you can compare different groups' performances. Do users with a college degree in mathematics perform better than those without? How does performance vary by age groups?

7. **Consistency**: Some users might have widely varying times, indicating they might be easily distracted or have inconsistent focus. Others might be very consistent, indicating strong concentration.

8. **Response to Mistakes**: If you track incorrect answers, you can analyze how users respond post-mistake. Do they tend to slow down, indicating caution? Or do they speed up, possibly in frustration or eagerness to move past the error?

9. **Adaptive Difficulty**: If your game adjusts in difficulty based on performance, you can analyze how quickly users adapt to more challenging questions. This could provide insights into their adaptability and resilience.
